# anki-docker
## Where can I get the docker image from?

I don't publish one - maintining it seems like it would be very, very painful.
If you want to use this Dockerfile yourself, I would suggest checking out or
cloning this repository and building it yourself. It should work for the given
version of Anki but if it doesn't, you're on your own.

Good luck!
